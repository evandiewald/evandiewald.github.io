In this project, we will adapt and fine-tune a pre-trained Caduceus model for DNA sequence classification tasks provided by the Genomic Benchmarks datasets. While these benchmark datasets are publicly available on HuggingFace, we also provide an optional workflow to import the sequences into AWS HealthOmics and pull them into the fine-tuning job. Genomic research organizations who have access to their own, proprietary sequence datasets (e.g. FASTA/FASTQ/BAM format), could use a similar workflow to train custom models. **Presented at AWS Analyticon 2025.**
